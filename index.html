        <h1>Natural Disasters in Southeast Asia</h1>
        <p>From 2010 to 2021, Southeast Asia has been marked by frequent and devastating natural disasters, ranging from storms and earthquakes to volcanic eruptions and floods.
          This page presents a comprehensive presentation of these events through a series of interactive visualisations. Navigate through them to better understand how different
          countries in Southeast Asia have experienced natural disasters over the past decade.</p>

          <h2>Natural Disasters</h2>
          <p>This proportional symbol map visualises the location, type, and number of casualties (including injuries and deaths) caused by natural disasters across Southeast Asia. 
             Use the filters to select a specific country, disaster type, or year.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <p>The most prominent natural disasters in Southeast Asia are floods, storms, and earthquakes. The Philippines and Indonesia experience the highest occurrences of these events.
           This map also highlights regional hotspots for different disaster types. For instance, storms significantly impact the Philippines due to its location along the Pacific typhoon belt. 
           Meanwhile, volcanic activity mainly occurs in Indonesia, which sits on the Pacific Ring of Fireâ€”a region known for its high concentration of active volcanoes.

          <h2>Natural Disaster Risk</h2>
          <p>This choropleth map visualises the overall natural disaster risk in Southeast Asian countries. The colour scale indicates risk levels.</p>

        <div id="vis2" class="vis-container"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <p>The countries with the highest risk of natural disasters are the Philippines and Vietnam, due to the high frequency of natural disasters relative to their population and land area.
           In contrast, countries like Brunei and Laos have much lower risk levels, reflecting their more stable geographical locations and reduced exposure to natural hazards.</p>

      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <p>Despite its relatively small land area, the Philippines experiences the highest frequency of natural disasters, underscoring its highly vulnerable geographical location. 
           Indonesia also faces frequent disasters due to its large land area and exposure to various natural hazards. In contrast, nations like Singapore and Timor-Leste experience
           far fewer disaster occurrences, not only because of their smaller land areas but also due to their more stable geographical positions.</p>

          <h2>Proportion of Natural Disasters</h2>

      </div>
      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <p>For most Southeast Asian countries, floods are the dominant type of natural disaster, reflecting the region's vulnerability to heavy rainfall. 
           However, in the Philippines, storms are the most common disaster type, highlighting its vulnerability to tropical cyclones. Meanwhile, Indonesia experiences a mix of natural hazards,
           with earthquakes and landslides also playing significant roles.</p>

          <h2>Deaths per Year by Country</h2>

      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <p>The years 2013 and 2018 stand out for having the highest number of deaths caused by natural disasters in the region. In 2013, the Philippines was hit hardest, largely due to Typhoon Haiyan,
           one of the most powerful storms ever recorded, resulting in significant loss of life. Similarly, in 2018, Indonesia saw a sharp increase in deaths, mainly caused by the earthquake (tsunami) in Sulawesi 
           and the volcanic eruption of Anak Krakatao. The number of deaths fluctuates year by year, underscoring the unpredictability of natural disasters in the region.</p>

          <h2>The Deadliest Natural Disaster Types</h2>
          <p>This lollipop chart illustrates the average number of deaths caused by each type of natural disaster, identifying which ones tend to be the most dangerous in terms of human life.</p>

      <div class="pure-u-1-1">
        <p>Epidemics and earthquakes are the deadliest natural disaster types on average, causing the highest number of fatalities. Volcanic activities and storms also rank high, contributing significantly to the death toll in the region.
           On the other hand, droughts and mass movements (dry) have the lowest average fatalities, reflecting their generally less lethal nature compared to other disaster types.</p>
